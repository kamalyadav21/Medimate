# Medimate
In order to run the file, you have to install flask (pip install flask) and flask_sqlalchemy (pip install flask_sqlalchemy). After this run the python file doctors.py on terminal to host it on the server displayed thereafter and open home.html. After this, you can navigate through the website and explore it's features.
You have to extract the folder Medimate.zip to access all the files.

The password for accessing the doctors' page is admin. Medimate suggests doctors based on the symptoms described by the patient. It works based on the data fed to it.
A demo video has been uploaded for the same. Thank you :)
