In order to run the file, you have to install flask (pip install flask) and flask_sqlalchemy (pip install flask_sqlalchemy). After this run the python file doctors.py on terminal to host it on the server displayed thereafter and open home.html. After this, you can navigate through the website and explore it's features.

A demo video has been uploaded for the same. Thank you :)
